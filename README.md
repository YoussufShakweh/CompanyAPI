# Company Database API
This repository contains an API for the Company Database, built using the **Django framework** and **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**. The project is inspired by the concepts discussed in **Fundamentals of Database Systems** by **Ramez Elmasri**.

## Overview
The Company Database API allows users to interact with company-related data. It provides endpoints for querying, adding, updating, and deleting information related to:

1. Departments: Handle department information, including department names and locations.
2. Employees: Manage employee records, including details such as first name, last name, email, salary, and department.
3. Dependents: Track dependents associated with employees (family members).
