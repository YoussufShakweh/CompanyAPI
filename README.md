# Company Database API
This repository contains an API for the Company Database, built using the **Django framework** and **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**. The project is inspired by the concepts discussed in **Fundamentals of Database Systems** by **Ramez Elmasri**.

## Overview
The Company Database API allows users to interact with company-related data. It provides endpoints for querying, adding, updating, and deleting information related to employees, departments, projects, and other relevant entities.
